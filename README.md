# ObjectOrientedProgramming
Intermediate course introducing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with the Java language.
It covers the evolution of programming languages, the limitations of procedural programming, and the key features of OOP. The course includes various modules that delve into the basics of Java, object-oriented design, data structures, generics, functional programming, exceptions, and multi-threading. Each module is accompanied by practical lab exercises to reinforce the concepts learned.
