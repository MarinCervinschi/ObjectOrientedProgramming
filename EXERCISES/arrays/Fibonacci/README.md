**[Fibonacci.java]** Write a method accepting an int and returning a long[] composed of the first n numbers of the
Fibonacci series.

Examples:

* fibonacci(1) → [0]
* fibonacci(2) → [0, 1]
* fibonacci(5) → [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

The method has the following prototype:

```
public static long[] fibonacci(int n);
```

where:

* **n** is the number of Fibonacci numbers to be generated.
