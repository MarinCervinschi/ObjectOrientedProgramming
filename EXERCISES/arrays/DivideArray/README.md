**[DivideArray.java]** Write a method accepting a double[] and a double value returning a different double[]
representing the original double[] divided by factor.

Examples:

* divideArray([1, 1, 1], 2.0) → [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
* divideArray([2, 1, 1], 1.0) → [2.0, 1.0, 1.0]
* divideArray([10, 10], 10.0) → [1.0, 1.0]

The method has the following prototype:

```
public static double[] divideArray(double[] v, double factor);
```

where:

* **v** is the double[] array to be processed.
* **factor** is the divisor to be used.
